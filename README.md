JUNGSTER3000

A very simple platformer. Only 3 levels long and a little memorization heavy but still fun.

This was the final project for ICS4UO, a grade 12 high school course. I think the code reflects that fairly well. It was created in 2 months as a collaberation between me and 7 other friends.

We were generally given little to no direction and told to create whatever we wanted to. All outside interaction required outside research from our group, as we weren't taught how to use swing or do things like read from the keyboard. The bulk of this researc was done by me and Christiaan.

I am well aware that it is full of bugs, most noticeably the movement related one where you jump next to the top of a wall while moving towards it and can move slightly inside it. These weren't fixed because of time and other things being declared more important.

If I was to redo this, and I might someday for fun, I would spend time planning the class structure better and find a way to unlock the framerate and unlink it from the game speed. Hitboxes are an area that could definitely use the most improvement beyond that.
